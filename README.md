# My Firefox Settings
1. user.js and css files
1. Better privacy and removing clutter from the browser
1. The large majority of this is not my work and i dont take credit

## What it comes from

- [Betterfox user.js](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) - I re enabled the sync but may disable it again 
- [Bali10050 - FirefoxCSS](https://github.com/Bali10050/FirefoxCSS) - mostly the same as this with a few minor tweeks to the toolbar and bookmarks

## What I Changed
- At the bottom of each file there are comments of what i changed (i think for everything if not i just commented some stuff out)
- Compact mode turned on
### I pretty much just made this README for fun lol
