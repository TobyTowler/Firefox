# My Firefox Settings
user.js and css files
Better privacy and removing clutter from the browser
The large majority of this is not my work and i dont take credit
## What it comes from
- Betterfox user.js - I re enabled the sync but my disable it again
- [https://github.com/Bali10050 - Firefox ](https://github.com/Bali10050/FirefoxCSS) - mostly the same as this with a few minor tweeks to the toolbar and bookmarks

## What I Changed
At the bottom of each file there are comments of what i changed (i think for everything if not i just commented some stuff out)

### I pretty much just made this README for fun lol
